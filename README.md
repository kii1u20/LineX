The app is designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for coordinating schedules with groups of people. By allowing users to share their personal calendar and see how it aligns with others, the app makes it easier to find mutually convenient times for events and meetings. Additionally, by providing tools for communication, such as friend lists and event invites, the app makes it easier to keep track of everyone's availability and coordinate plans. With these features, the app aims to streamline the scheduling process and reduce the confusion and frustration often associated with coordinating schedules with large groups of people.

The back-end is implemented using Azure Functions, and the front end runs on Google's App Engine, using NodeJS. The UI was written entirely in JavaScript using the VueJS framework.
